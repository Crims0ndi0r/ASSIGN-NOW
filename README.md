# ASSIGN-NOW
As I now is meant to bridge the gap between students of universities and their teachers through this platform it will be able to allow the teachers to give out assignments on a larger scale making it easier for the teacher to access the assignments and also it has time-based assignments and can also be used to set up test for the students 
it would also help in setting up tests assignments and various other projects which in turn makes it easier for the teacher and students it would also have a an automated system which helps to collects and time tests and assignments to avoid overdue assignments and also help in students and teachers ratings.
it should also have a ranking to help know which student submits most assignments and also have rewards for students and summit assignments without copying from the others.
you should also be able to discern which assignment is different from the others even though it has been copied.
